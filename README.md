# project
The whole code consists of 3 classes in total: the main class, the Lexical Analyzer class, and 
the Syntax Analyzer class. As known, the Lexical Analyzer class was the essential Java 
source code of the first part of the project and furthermore for implementation details, it’s 
used as a tool for the Syntax Analyzer class. The main class on the other hand is the class that 
holds everything together and what should be run to start the code.The main class first asks the user for the input file name to lexically analyze the input as desired in the first part of the project. If the input is lexically correct, later the Lexical 
Analyzer calls the Syntax Analyzer class to continue with parsing.Therefore, to run the code, it’s enough to run the main class and enter the input file name with the “.txt” extension to avoid IO Exception.
